# Key Features of S-PHP

S-PHP is designed to make development both fast and secure, providing essential tools that simplify common web application tasks. Below are the key features included in the framework:

## 1. **Simple Routing System**

Define application routes easily and handle HTTP requests with minimal configuration. The routing system provides flexibility for developers to map URLs to specific actions.

## 2. **CSRF Token Validation**

Prevents Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks by validating tokens in each form submission, ensuring that requests are legitimate and come from your own application.

## 3. **XXS Prevention**

Built-in mechanisms to escape user input, which helps prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks by ensuring malicious scripts are not injected into the application.

## 4. **SQL Injection Prevention**

S-PHP automatically protects against SQL injection attacks by using parameterized queries, ensuring that user input does not interfere with database operations.

## 5. **Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)**

A simple ORM allows developers to interact with the database through PHP objects, abstracting away the need for raw SQL and making it easier to work with data.

## 6. **Database Connection**

Easily configure and connect to a variety of databases. S-PHP provides simple integration for database operations, including CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality.

## 7. **Controllers**

Organize your application's business logic into controllers, which handle requests and responses, improving the maintainability and scalability of your application.

## 8. **Views**

S-PHP comes with a view system that separates the presentation layer from the application logic, making it easy to render dynamic HTML content using templates.

## 9. **Models**

Define models to represent your application's data and business logic, simplifying interactions with the database and streamlining the development process.
